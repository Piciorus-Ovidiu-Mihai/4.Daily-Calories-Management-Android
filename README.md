# Daily-Calories-Management-Android
I finished the Android Fundamentals courses from Google the Digital Workshop.
With all the knowledge I gained I made an application for Daily Calories Management.With this application you can track all calories that you eat everyday, take photos of your food and make a list with all food you usually eat.


## What I used for the application
Firstly, I made register and login with firebase. I have a menu with Navigation Drawer. I used Fragments for each page and Constraint Layout for arranging all buttons, plaintext,textview,recyclerview and cards view. Also , I integrate Camera for taking photos.
These are only some things I used in my application,behind all logical operations to make this application to work properly.


## There are some photos with the application
